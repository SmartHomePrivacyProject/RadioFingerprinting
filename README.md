# Robust Deep-learning-based Radio Fingerprinting with Fine-Tuning

In this project, we study radio fingerprinting. Radio fingerprinting is a way of distinguishing a tramisster from others of the same type by analyzing raw I/Q data  in wireless communications. Each tramisster has a unique finerprint due to hardware imperfections on radio-frequency circuitry. The hardware imperhections include I/Q imbalance, phase noise, frequency offset, and sampling off-set. Specifically, given I/Q data collected on a receiver side, a receiver decides which transmitter it is in radio fingerprinting.
